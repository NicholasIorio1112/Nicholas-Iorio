		  <p><font size="5" font face="candara">This is our second big project! We had to make a game in MIT App Inventor. Our game is a version of space invaders. The object of the game is to hit the space ship above and to get your own high score!</font></p>

		  <p><font size="5" font face="candara">Here is our Python project! I worked with Owen to make our interactive story. We used Python 2.7 which allowed us to use more modern comands and inputs. In the beginning we had trouble getting through the initial learning curve of Python but we were able to power through. Our story is based off of a party scenario where you will be given tough choices. Will you refuse tempting offers? Will you go on an amazing adventure? Will you survive? Find out with our awesome story!</font></p>

<p><font size="5" font face="candara">This is my modified simulation project! The original simulation was just your ordinary firework show. But that was too simple, so I used a program called NetLogo to modify it. It needed to be more interesting so I made all the fireworks shoot extremely fast. To do this I multiplied the velocity in both the x and the y axis by 100 to make them launch quicker. If you were to run the simulation now you would see a quick barrage of fireworks.</font></p>

		  <p><font size="5" font face="candara">This is my graph made in Python! My question was "Who makes more money selling phones, Apple or Samsung?" so to answer this I went to business insider's website and found a large data file which showed the revenue of Apple vs Samsung up until 2016. The graph has helped me answer my question by showing that Apple is making more money off of their phones than Samsung is. Making this graph was extremely difficult for me because it was my first time but i'm glad I have the experience so that next time I have to show off data I can do it quickly and efficiently.</font></p>
